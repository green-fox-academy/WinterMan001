    <h3> Happy Life </h3>
    <p> <i> IT is clear to you, I know, Lucilius, that no one can lead a happy life, or even one that is
            bearable, without the pursuit of wisdom, and that the perfection of wisdom is what makes the
            happy life, although even the beginnings of wisdom make life bearable. Yet this conviction, clear
            as it is, needs to be strengthened and given deeper roots through daily reflection; making noble
            resolutions is not as important as keeping the resolutions you have made already. You have to
            persevere and fortify your pertinacity until the will to good becomes a disposition to good. So
            you needn‟t go in for all this long-winded protestation or say any more on the subject – I‟m well
            aware that you‟ve made a great deal of progress. I realize the feelings that prompt you to put 
            these things in your letter, and there is no pretence or speciousness about them. But – to give you
            my honest opinion – at this stage, although I have great hopes of you, I do not yet feel quite
            confident about you. And I should like you to adopt the same attitude: you‟ve no grounds for
            forming a ready, hasty belief in yourself. Carry out a searching analysis and close scrutiny of
            yourself in all sorts of different lights. Consider above all else whether you‟ve advanced in
            philosophy or just in actual years.
    </i> </p>
    
    <h4>Sad Life</h4>
    <p2> <i> „Come now,‟ you will be asking, „are you saying that I should forget a person who has
            been a friend?‟ Well, you are not proposing to keep him very long in your memory if his
            memory is to last just as long as your grief. At any moment something or other will happen that
            will turn that long face of yours into a smiling one. I do not see very much time going by before
            the sense of loss is mitigated and even the keenest sorrowings settle down. Your face will cease
            to be its present picture of sadness as soon as you take your eyes off yourself. At the moment you
            are keeping a watch on your grief – but even as you do it is fading away, and the keener it is the
            quicker it is in stopping. </i> </p2>

    <h5>Pleasures</h5>
    <p3> <i>Pleasures, moreover, are of two kinds. The physical pleasures are the ones which illness
            interferes with, though it does not do away with them altogether – indeed, if you take a true view
            of the matter, they are actually sharpened by illness, a man deriving greater pleasure from
            drinking something when he is thirsty and finding food all the more welcome through being
            hungry, anything set before one after one has had to fast being greeted with a heightened
            appetite. But no doctor can refuse his patient those other, greater and surer pleasures, the
            pleasures of the mind and spirit. Anyone who follows these and genuinely knows them pays no
            attention whatever to all the enticements of the senses. „How very unfortunate he is,‟ people say,
            „to be sick like that!‟ Why? Because he isn‟t melting snow in his wine? Because he isn‟t
            breaking ice into a bumper goblet to keep the drink he has mixed in it chilled? Because Lucrine
            oysters aren‟t being opened before him at his table? Because there isn‟t any bustling of cooks
            about the dining-room, bringing in not just the viands themselves but the actual cooking
            apparatus along with them? For this is the latest innovation in luxurious living, having the
            kitchen accompany the dinner in to the table so as to prevent any of the food losing its heat and
            avoid anything being at a temperature insufficiently scalding for palates which are nowadays like
            leather. „How very unfortunate he is to be sick,‟ they say. In fact he‟ll be eating just as much as
            he‟ll digest. There won‟t be a whole boar lying somewhere where people can see it, conveying
            the impression that it has been banished from the table as being too cheap and ordinary a piece of
            meat to be on it, nor will he have his trolley piled high with – now that people think it not quite
            nice to see the whole bird – carved breast of fowl. And what‟s so bad about your being deprived
            of that? You may be eating like a sick man, but you‟ll at last be eating in the way a healthy man
            should. </i> <p3>
